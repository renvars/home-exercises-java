1st question:
    Well it was consistent since it will check of the type of data that is there.
    A wildcard <?> from my understanding means that the list could by of any type BUT it has to be the same, so when checking
    for the first element it can be easily found which Type it is.
2nd question:
    If there was no wildcard then I could do that but it would be repetitive and would take some time to create.
    If there was a wildcard for the data (for example from another method) then I would not be able to cast it to the
    correct Type!
